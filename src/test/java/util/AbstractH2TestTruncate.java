 * This is the base test class to use whenever a rollback is not appropriate

 * 
 * Instead of performing a rollback at the end of each test, it will truncate
 * (delete all rows from all tables) and begin a new transaction.
 * 
 * An example of when to extend this base class is if the code under test is
 * performing its own commits, which will not be able to be rolled back.
